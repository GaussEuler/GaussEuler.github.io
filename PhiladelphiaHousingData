# Machine Learning on the Philadelphia Housing Data

### Introduction
A machine learning student dealing with housing data may already be familiar with the Boston Housing Data and the Ames (Iowa) 
Housing Data. Hence, instead of these familiar datasets, I am going to work on the Philadelphia Housing Dataset to predict
house prices using machine learning algorithms (Ridge, Lasso, Random Forests, XGBoost and Neural Networks). From whatwoI know,
there is no comprehensive data analysis and machine learning work done of this Philadelphia dataset, so the analysis below may
not only be useful as an exercise in learning basic data analysis and machine learning techniques, but also to get a glimpse of
the real estate in Philadelphia - the first capital of the United States!

The work is organized in the following way:
I. We shall download the data and briefly try to understand the features in the dataset
II. Pre-process the data to better suite the needs of the machine learning algorithms
III. Use the various algorithms to learn on the dataset and find the best algorithm to make the prediction


## I. The Philadelphia Housing Dataset:
The dataset in the comma-separated-values (csv) format can be found [here](https://beta.phila.gov/property/data/?resource=csv).
Note: This 'opa_properties_public' csv dataset is a very large file!
Once you store in a proper folder, we are good to go...
