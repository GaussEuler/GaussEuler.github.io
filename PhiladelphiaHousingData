# Machine Learning on the Philadelphia Housing Data using Python

### Introduction
A machine learning student dealing with housing data may already be familiar with the Boston Housing Data and the Ames (Iowa) 
Housing Data. Hence, instead of these familiar datasets, I am going to work on the Philadelphia Housing Dataset to predict
house prices using machine learning algorithms (Ridge, Lasso, Random Forests, XGBoost and Neural Networks). From whatwoI know,
there is no comprehensive data analysis and machine learning work done of this Philadelphia dataset, so the analysis below may
not only be useful as an exercise in learning basic data analysis and machine learning techniques, but also to get a glimpse of
the real estate in Philadelphia - the first capital of the United States!

The work is organized in the following way:
I. We shall download the data and briefly try to understand the features in the dataset
II. Pre-process the data to better suite the needs of the machine learning algorithms
III. Use the various algorithms to learn on the dataset and find the best algorithm to make the prediction

Before proceeding to the actual work, I would especially like to thank Dr. Andreas Mueller [@amueller] - his book "Introduction
to Machine Learning with Python" helped me learn and understand Scikit-Learn Machine Learning algorithms and techniques. 
I also learned from Kaggle, especially the four tutorials on machine learning on housing data:
[Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques#tutorials)

## I. The Philadelphia Housing Dataset: Understanding the features
The dataset in the comma-separated-values (csv) format can be found [here](https://beta.phila.gov/property/data/?resource=csv).
Note: This 'opa_properties_public' csv dataset is a very large file!
Once you store in a proper folder, we are good to go...

First, we import the basic libraries:
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # our default library for making plots
import seaborn as sns # we shall use seaborn sometimes to make some pretty plots
import pickle # to save the DataFrame

### I-1. Importing the Philadelphia Housing Data (opa_properties_public) saved in my computer:

all_data = pd.read_csv(r'C:\Users\...\opa_properties_public.csv')
Note: Substitute the three dots (...) with appropriate address from your computer.
